	    <h2>A SPECAL WORLD</h2>
	    	<p>

 A special world for you and me
 A special bond one cannot see
 It wraps us up in its cocoon
 And holds us fiercely in its womb.

 Its fingers spread like fine spun gold
 Gently nestling us to the fold
 Like silken thread it holds us fast
 Bonds like this are meant to last.

 And though at times a thread may break
 A new one forms in its wake
 To bind us closer and keep us strong
 In a special world, where we belong.

	    <h2>ONE WISH</h2>
	    	<p>If I could have just one wish,
 I would wish to wake up everyday
 to the sound of your breath on my neck,
 the warmth of your lips on my cheek,
 the touch of your fingers on my skin,
 and the feel of your heart beating with mine...
 Knowing that I could never find that feeling
 with anyone other than you.

	     <div id="third">
	    <h2>BECAUSE OF YOU</h2>
	    	<p>A gentle word like a spark of light,
 Illuminates my soul
 And as each sound goes deeper,
 It's YOU that makes me whole

 There is no corner, no dark place,
 YOUR LOVE cannot fill
 And if the world starts causing waves,
 It's your devotion that makes them still

 And yes you always speak to me,
 In sweet honesty and truth
 Your caring heart keeps out the rain,
 YOUR LOVE, the ultimate roof

 So thank you my Love for being there,
 For supporting me, my life
 I'll do the same for you, you know,
 My Beautiful, Darling Wife(not yet but still :).

<p>Well now you've seen how strongly I feel about us. One day we will live in a huge house <img src="house.jpg" />all to ourselves, achived by our hard earned profit toghether. I really pray and hope to the Lord that this works out because I have reached a point in my life where I find it hard to move on without you or even imagine life without you. Just imagine how beautiful our children<img src="children.jpg" /> will be. Through God we will be successful toghether, in our dream house driving our dream cars <img class="car" src="car1.jpg" /> <img class="car" src="car2.jpg" />. After all is said and done and the early parts of our life is over we can live happily together in Christ and finally grow old together <img src="old.jpg" />. I LOVE YOU!. HAPPY ANNIVERSARY!!!!!!!!!!!.</p>
