        <p>Happy Anniversary love, we've been through a lot and even went to the point of giving up but we fought and saved our relationship everytime.
        It's been a year now since we met and everyday just gives me one more reason to love you, my love for you grows stonger still, I never grow tired of you, I will always love you and there is no one I'd rather spend my life with than my one true love, yes darling that's you. Happy ANNIVERSARY!!!! take all the time you need to enjoy this gift I took forever to think about -_-, and slaved over :) Just to make you feel special. I really love you Shamalie and if God permitts it I will grow old with you :D </p>
